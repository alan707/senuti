        <h3 id="MyiPodisntformatedforaMacwillSenutistillwork">My iPod isn't formated for a Mac, will Senuti still work?</h3>
        <p>As long as your iPod has been prepared correctly (read the <a href="start.html">Quick Start</a> if you haven't already), then yes, it should work fine.</p>
        <h3 id="WillSenutirecovermyphotosoffofmyiPod">Will Senuti recover my photos off of my iPod?</h3>
        <p>If you enabled the preference to copy the full resolution versions of your photos to your iPod, then you can enable disk use and copy them off in the Finder.</p>
        <h3 id="WillSenutirecovermyvideosoffofmyiPod">Will Senuti recover my videos off of my iPod?</h3>
        <p>Yes, they work just like songs.</p>
        <h3 id="HowcanIrecreateallofmyplaylists">How can I recreate all of my playlists?</h3>
        <p>Drag and drop each playlist to copy it to iTunes.  Senuti will take care of the rest.</p>
        <h3 id="DragginganddroppingsongstoiTunesdoesntwork">Dragging and dropping songs to iTunes doesn't work</h3>
        <p>In order to use the drag and drop capabilities of Senuti, you must drag and drop to the iTunes item that is <strong>within</strong> Senuti's source list.  Dragging and dropping to the iTunes application is not supported.</p>
        <h3 id="MymusicdoesnotappearinSenutiwhenIpluginmyiPod">My music does not appear in Senuti when I plug in my iPod</h3>
        <p>Please be sure that Disk Use is enabled.  Read the <a href="start.html">Quick Start</a> if you haven't already.</p>
        <h3 id="MymusicappearsinSenutiforasecondandthendisappears">My music appears in Senuti for a second, and then disappears</h3>
        <p>Please be sure that Disk Use is enabled.  Read the <a href="start.html">Quick Start</a> if you haven't already.</p>
        <h3 id="MymusicdoesntshowupwhereIcopieditbutitplaysiniTunes">My music doesn't show up where I copied it, but it plays in iTunes</h3>
        <p>iTunes is probably making a second copy of your music because of how your preferences are set.  When Senuti detects that two copies of songs are being made, it removes the one that iTunes isn't using.</p>
        <h3 id="AllofthesongsthatIcopiedwithSenutiareskipping">All of the songs that I copied with Senuti are skipping</h3>
        <p>A few people have had this problem.  Senuti uses underlying OS X functions to copy files, so it shouldn't have anything to do with Senuti.  Many people with this issue acutally have a bad Firewire or USB cord.  Try a new cord, and if the issue still exists, then <a href="http://trac.fadingred.org/senuti/wiki/ReportingBugs">report it as a bug</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="IusedSenutiandnowallofmymusicisgone">I used Senuti and now all of my music is gone</h3>
        <p>Usually when this happens, it is because your iPod was set up to link with iTunes, and when iTunes asked, you said <i>Yes</i> that it was okay to link with it when you should have said <strong>No</strong> or <strong>Cancel</strong>.  The default for that button is <strong>No</strong> for a good reason.  This was iTunes that asked you the question, and not Senuti.  The <a href="start.html">Quick Start instructions</a>, they would have led you to information about <a href="start.html#prepare">preparing your iPod</a> which also instructs you to click <strong>No</strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="CanIgetmymusicbacknowthatitsbeenerasedfrommyiPod">Can I get my music back now that it's been erased from my iPod</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, no.  You should begin re-ripping your CD collection.  If you purchased music from the iTunes Music Store, you should probably call Apple.  They do not usually allow people to download music a second time, but if you tell them that you thought your music was backed up on your iPod and that you never thought that iTunes would erase all of your music, then you might get somewhere.  This is just a recommendation and not by any means a promise that you will be able to recover your music that way.</p>
