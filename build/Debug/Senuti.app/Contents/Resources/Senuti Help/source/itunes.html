		<h2>Using Senuti and iTunes together</h2>
		<p>Senuti has many features that make life easier by integrating with iTunes.</p>
		<h3>Use care when using iTunes integration</h3>
		<p>Senuti copies the songs you specify to iTunes, then when finished copying, adds them to iTunes.  Adding songs to iTunes requires iTunes to be open, and Senuti will launch it without asking.  If you have your iPod configured to automatically sync with iTunes, songs you want to copy on your iPod could be removed by iTunes.  For more information, please read <a href="start.html#prepare">Preparing your iPod</a> in the Quick start section.</p>
		<h3>Recognizing when songs are already in iTunes</h3>
		<p>Senuti conveniently marks songs that are already in iTunes by placing a note next to them.  You can hide these songs by choosing <i>Hide Songs in iTunes</i> in the <i>View</i> menu.</p>
		
		<h3>Adding songs to iTunes</h3>
		    <h4>Having Senuti always add songs to iTunes</h4>
    		<p>You can configure Senuti to add songs to iTunes whenever you copy songs to you computer.  To do this, open the preferences and switch to the copying section of the preferences.  You can have Senuti simply add songs to your iTunes library, or you can have them copied into a specific playlist.</p>
    		<h4>Drag and drop songs into iTunes</h4>
    		<p>It is simple to add songs to iTunes regardless of your preferences.  Simply select the songs you want to copy, then drag them to iTunes in the source list.  The songs will be copied to your save location then added to iTunes.  You can also add the songs to playlists in iTunes by dropping them over any applicable playlist (smart playlists are not applicable).</p>
    		<h4>Drag and drop playlists into iTunes</h4>
    		<p>Playlists can be added through drag and drop, too.  All of the songs in the playlist will be copied to your save location, then added to iTunes.  If a playlist with the name of the one you're dropping exists in iTunes, songs will be added to that playlist.  Otherwise a new playlist with that name will be created.</p>
